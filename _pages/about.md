<br>
I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work mainly on topics in labor economics, public economics, and industrial organization, using empirical evidence and economic theory.
<!--
My current research focuses on labor and consumer markets of new forms and structures (often driven by technological innovation), in particular how these markets function fundamentally differently from traditional markets, and efficiency and incidence of institutions designed to adapt to new market features in these markets.
